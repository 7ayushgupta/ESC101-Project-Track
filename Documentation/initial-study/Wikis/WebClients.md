## JavaScript and WebClients

Web server software (e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX, Lighttpd) usually is used to deliver content and most of times it runs on servers located in data centers. Web client is an application (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) running on a local device (desktop, notebook, cell phone) used to interact mainly with Web servers even though you can use your Web client to access servers running protocols others than HTTP and 
HTTPS.

 In Python, the process reaches even higher levels of convenience and flexibility. Three modules provide most of the functionality you will need: HTTPLIB, URLLIB, and a newer addition, XMLRPCLIB. In true Pythonesque fashion, each module builds upon its predecessor, providing a solid, well-designed base for your applications.
