## Databases


Databases offer numerous functionalities by which one can manage large amounts of information easily over the web, and high-volume data input and output over a typical file such as a text file. SQL is a query language and is very popular in databases. Many websites use MySQL. SQLite is a “light” version that works over syntax very much similar to SQL.

SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine. It is the most used database engine in the world wide web.
Python has a library to access SQLite databases, called sqlite3, intended for working with this database which has been included with Python package since version 2.5.
