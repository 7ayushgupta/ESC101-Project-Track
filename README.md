### Timeline

* 25th February: Learnt how Websockets work, and how we require a HTTP server to serve requests from a browser. Used an implementation of a webserver in Python, [SimpleWebSocketServer](https://github.com/dpallot/simple-websocket-server).

* 27th February: Added basic Frontend elements, still need to figure out the complete Frontend layout. Urgent TODO: Form the backend quickly

* 1st March: Changing backend server from Python to a NodeJS HTTP Server, front-end remains some. Decision taken due to a lot of shortcomings using a Python backend, such as poor support of handling events, etc. (Would have to use a lot of libraries and still would not have got the required result)

* 6th March: Implementing Passport.js for session rememberance, and authentication. Quite a lot of work. Working on Routes, since if authentication is added, the server needs to handle if someone unauthenticated doesn't get sensitive (:P) information.
